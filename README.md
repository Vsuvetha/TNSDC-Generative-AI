Skin Cancer Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

                          Skin cancer detection is a crucial task in healthcare, where early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to automate the process of skin cancer detection from images.
                          

Project Overview:
          This project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying skin lesions as either benign or malignant. The CNN architecture is trained on a dataset of skin lesion images annotated with their corresponding labels.
          

Techniques Used:
1.Data Collection
   2.Data Preprocessing
   3.Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Modeling
   4.Model Evaluation
   5.Packages Required
   6.NumPy
   7.Pandas
   8.TensorFlow
   9.Keras
  10.Matplotlib
  11.Scikit-learn (for model evaluation)

  
Dataset:
      The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of skin lesion images along with their corresponding labels (benign or malignant). It is essential to ensure a balanced dataset to avoid biases in model training.
      

Model Architecture:
      The CNN architecture typically consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The model learns hierarchical features from the input images, enabling it to make accurate predictions.
      

Model Evaluation:
      The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, visualization techniques such as confusion matrices and ROC curves may be employed to assess the model's performance comprehensively.
