Skin Cancer Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
# Project Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying skin lesions as either benign or malignant. The CNN architecture is trained on a dataset of skin lesion images annotated with their corresponding labels.
