Skin Cancer Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Skin cancer detection is a crucial task in healthcare, where early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to automate the process of skin cancer detection from images.

# Project Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying skin lesions as either benign or malignant. The CNN architecture is trained on a dataset of skin lesion images annotated with their corresponding labels.

# Techniques Used
- Data Collection
- Data Preprocessing
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Modeling
- Model Evaluation
- Packages Required
- NumPy
- Pandas
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (for model evaluation)
# Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of skin lesion images along with their corresponding labels (benign or malignant). It is essential to ensure a balanced dataset to avoid biases in model training.

# Model Architecture
The CNN architecture typically consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The model learns hierarchical features from the input images, enabling it to make accurate predictions.

# Model Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, visualization techniques such as confusion matrices and ROC curves may be employed to assess the model's performance comprehensively.

# Usage
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required packages listed in the requirements.txt file.
- Run the provided Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks to train and evaluate the CNN model.
- Use the trained model to make predictions on new skin lesion images.
# Steps
- Importing packages
- Reading the dataset
- Data Preprocessing (e.g., normalization, reshaping)
